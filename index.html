        <h1>Hey everyone! ðŸ‘‹</h1>
        <p>
            Welcome to BitByBit, the DSA Community of TeamCodeLocked! This isnâ€™t a course or a one-time event, itâ€™s a space where we learn, practice, and grow together. The idea is simple â€” to actually build a coding culture where everyone pushes each other to improve. Youâ€™ll always have people around to help if youâ€™re stuck, but the real value comes when you explore, fail, fix, and figure things out on your own.
        </p>
        <p>
            Weâ€™re starting with Data Structures and Algorithms because it forms the foundation for every strong coder and plays a massive role in the placements and internships we all aim for. The people who do well arenâ€™t necessarily the smartest, theyâ€™re the most consistent. Solving one or two problems every day and understanding the logic behind them matters far more than finishing a hundred questions without thinking. Itâ€™s about learning how to think, how to approach problems, and how to stay at it ðŸ’ª
        </p>
        <p>
            Over time, weâ€™ll also be expanding into Competitive Programming, Web Development, and App Development. So just keep upskilling, stay curious, and keep growing with the community.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you ever feel unsure about where to start or how to learn a concept, feel free to DM us (the Group Admins). Thatâ€™s what the community is for.
        </p>
        <p>
            Since we have both beginners and intermediate coders here, weâ€™ll be starting from Topic 0, building a strong base, and then steadily leveling up together. Everyoneâ€™s journey is different, but weâ€™re all heading in the same direction.
        </p>

        <h2>For beginners ðŸŒ±</h2>
        <p>
            If youâ€™re just starting out, donâ€™t rush. Take some time to get comfortable with the basics of any programming language â€” C++, Java, or Python, whichever feels right for you. There are amazing YouTube tutorials, websites, and roadmaps you can follow, but remember, code along. Donâ€™t just watch. Build the habit of writing and running your own code.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                Start with VS Code or any editor you feel comfortable with. If you have experience in C, you can smoothly transition to C++ using this guide:

        </ul>
        <p>
            Feel free to pick any programming language or any resource that you feel comfortable with. The goal is to write code on your own and really understand how it works, not just follow instructions. Take your time, practice regularly, and youâ€™ll build a strong foundation for the practice problems and contests. Weâ€™ll support you throughout your journey!
